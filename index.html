        <p>The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is artâ€™s aim. The critic
            is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things. The
            highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.</p>

        <p>Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those
            who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the
            elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.</p>

        <p>There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.
            The nineteenth-century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass. The
            nineteenth-century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.</p>

        <p>The moral life of man forms part of the subject matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the
            perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be
            proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of
            style.</p>
